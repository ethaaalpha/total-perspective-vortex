This project is about building a pipeline to handle eeg data.

## eeg data
An **electroencephalogram** is a medical record of the electrical brain activity as signals.  
A classic setup of *eeg data* acquisition is by putting electrodes on living being head and then record the activity.  
These datas can be useful for research.  
In our case we want to determine when does the user do a movemement or think of doing a movement (like opening right hand and thinking of doing it).  

### electrical signals
The signal obtained by the *eeg setup* will be a electrical signal that can be represented like that :
// METTRE IMAGE SIGNAL ICI

# To look
- What is EEG data ?
    1. Display data with MNE package
- Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm ?
- "real time" data stream
- look for scipy

1. Implementer Preprocessing avec PCA, ICA..
2. Classicification
3. Running
